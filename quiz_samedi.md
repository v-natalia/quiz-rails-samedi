# quiz

# 1
How do you create a Rails app?
```
rails new name-app
```
# 2
How do you start coding a Rails project? Give the right sequence.
```
1.Coding the views
2.Coding the controllers
3.Coding the models
```
###### R: Model, controller, views

# 3
How do you generate a Song model with a title and a year ?
```
rails g model Song title year:integer
```
# 4
What are the 2 created files?
```
db/migrate/timestamp_create_songs.rb
app/models/song.rb

```
#  5
What is the rails command you should type then?
```
rails db:migrate
```
# 6
How do you add a category (ex: “rock” , “electro” , etc..) to your songs table using the correct Rails generator?
```
rails g migration AddCategoryToSongs category
rails g migration add_category_to_songs category
```
# 7
What is the created file?
```
db/migrate/timestamp_add_category_to_songs.rb
```
# 8
What is the rails command you should type again?
```
rails db:migrate
```

# 9
Add a validation on the presence of a song title in the models/song.rb file
```
class Song < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true
end

```

# 10
Now crash-test your model’s validation:
```
➜ rails c
irb(main):001> song = Song.new
=>
#<Song:0x00007fec34145488
...
irb(main):002> song
=>
#<Song:0x00007fec34145488
 id: nil,
 title: nil,
 year: nil,
 created_at: nil,
 updated_at: nil,
 category: nil>
irb(main):003> song.valid?
=> false
irb(main):004> song.errors.full_messages
=> ["Title can't be blank"]
irb(main):005> song.title = "Hey Jude"
=> "Hey Jude"
irb(main):006> song.valid?
=> true
irb(main):007> song.save
  TRANSACTION (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  Song Create (0.4ms)  INSERT INTO "songs" ("title", "year", "created_at", "updated_at", "category") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?) RETURNING "id"  [["title", "Hey Jude"], ["year", nil], ["created_at", "2024-06-08 12:22:04.198974"], ["updated_at", "2024-06-08 12:22:04.198974"], ["category", nil]]
  TRANSACTION (0.1ms)  commit transaction
=> true

```

# 11
What is the Rails flow you need to follow again and again? Give the correct order.
```
1.The Router is routing the HTTP request to controller#action.
2.The action is getting data from models.
3.Everything starts with an HTTP Request.
4.The action is rendering the view.
```
###### R: 3, 1, 2, 4

# 12
What are the 4 different parts inside an HTTP request?
###### R: verb, url, headers, body
# 13
Are the HTTP requests in the config/routes.rb associated with their 2 routes the same? Why?
```
get "/songs" => "songs#index"
post "/songs" => "songs#create"

# Explain it here
```
###### R: non, il s' agit d'une requete get ou une req post

# 14
What’s the difference between a GET and a POST request?
###### R: get recupere des infos du serveur, POST envoie des infos au serveur

# 15
Complete the controller code using the correct params key?
HTTP request: ```GET /search?query=thriller```
Routing in config/routes.rb: ```get "/search" => "songs#search"```


```
class SongsController < ApplicationController
  def search
    @songs = Song.where(title: params[:query])
    # @songs = Song.find_by(title: params[:query]) # trouve 1
  end
end

```
# 16
Complete the controller code using the correct params key?
HTTP request: ```GET /songs/named/thriller```
Routing in config/routes.rb: ```get "/songs/named/:name" => "songs#search"```

```
class SongsController < ApplicationController
  def search
    @songs = Song.where(title: params[:name])
  end
end

```
# 17
What are the 7 CRUD routes generated by the resources method ```resources :songs``` in Rails?
```

songs GET    /songs(.:format)                       songs#index
                                  POST   /songs(.:format)                       songs#create
                         new_song GET    /songs/new(.:format)                   songs#new
                        edit_song GET    /songs/:id/edit(.:format)              songs#edit
                             song GET    /songs/:id(.:format)                   songs#show
                                  PATCH  /songs/:id(.:format)                   songs#update
                                  PUT    /songs/:id(.:format)                   songs#update
                                  DELETE /songs/:id(.:format)                   songs#destroy

```

# 18
How do you print your routes and their URL prefix helpers?
```
rails routes
```
# 19
How do you generate a controller for your songs?
```
rails g controller songs
```
# 20
Implement the Read actions in your songs controller?
```
class SongsController < ApplicationController
    def index
    @songs = Song.all
  end

  def show
    @song = Song.find(params[:id])
  end
end

```


# 21
What are the 2 requests needed to create a new song? Implement the songs#new and songs#create actions.
```
class SongsController < ApplicationController
  def new #get
    @song = Song.new
  end

  def create #post
    @song = Song.new(song_params)
    if @song.save
      redirect_to song_path(@song)
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private
  def song_params
    params.require(:song).permit(:title, :year, :category)
  end
end
```

# 22
Why do we have to filter parameters using “strong params” in the controller?
###### R: pour securité, pour éviter que qqn puisse envoyer des données malicieuses, (se changer admin)

# 23
Hard question: What is the HTML generated? Fill in the blanks:

Imagine that:
```@song = Song.new```

Now what is the HTML code generated by:
```<%= form_for @song do |f| %>```
```<%= f.text_field :title %>```
```<%= f.submit %>```
```<% end %>```


```
<form action="/songs" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="song[title] " value=" ">
  <input type="submit" value="Create song">
</form>
```
# 24
Hard question: What is the HTML generated? Fill in the blanks.
Imagine that:
```@song #=> <#Song: id: 18, title: "Hey jude", year: 1968, category: "rock">```

Now what is the HTML code generated by:
```<%= form_for @song do |f| %>```
```<%= f.text_field :title %>```
```<%= f.submit %>```
```<% end %>```
```
<form action="/songs/:id" method="patch">
  <input type="text" name="song[title]" value="Hey Jude"/>
  <input type="submit" value="Update song"/>
</form>
```
# 25
Now you want to add reviews to your app. Here are some constraints:
-We don’t want our visitors to destroy or update reviews, just to create ones.
-We don’t want a separate index page to list all reviews or a show page to display each review. Instead, we want to display reviews on the show page of each song, for better UX.
-Generate your Review model in the terminal. It should have only a ```content:string``` and a ```song:references``` (the foreign key).
```
rails g model Review content:string song:references
```

# 26
Run the migration.
```
rails db:migrate
```
# 27
Add validations & associations.

Add a validation for the presence of a content.
Add associations between Review and Song
```
class Song < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true
  has_many :reviews
end

class Review < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :song
  validates :content, presence: true
end

```
# 28
Generate the reviews controller.
```
rails g controller Reviews

```
# 29
Add the necessary routes (we don’t want the 7 CRUD actions for reviews)
```
resources :songs do
  resources :reviews, only: [:new, :create]
end

```
# 30
Now code your controller.
```
class ReviewsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_song

  def new
    @review = Review.new
  end

  def create
    @review = Review.new(review_params)
    @review.song = @song #lien entre les 2 models
    if @review.save
      redirect_to song_path(@song)
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def set_song
    @song = Song.find(params[:song_id])
  end

  def review_params
    params.require(:review).permit(:content)
  end
end


```
# 31
Add a song’s reviews on its show page:
```
<h1><%= @song.title %></h1>
<p><%= @song.year %></p>
<p><%= @song.category %></p>

<h2>Here are the reviews for this song:</h2>
#TODO Add song's reviews.
# 1:N
# Has many - belongs to
# @song.reviews

<% @song.reviews.each do |review| %>
  <p><%= review.content %><p>
<% end %>
```
